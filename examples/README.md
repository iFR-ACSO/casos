## Description
This folder contains examples from system theory for nonlinear polynomial systems. The provided examples (dynamics, polynomial degrees etc.) and formulations are 
from the existing literature (see below).

## Running examples

It is assumed CaÎ£oS is installed correctly. See the main installation guide: https://github.com/iFR-ACSO/casos/#install 
1. Go to the root folder (see folder structure below)
2. Add the examples folder and its specific subfolders to the Matlab path as follows:
    -   In the command window type: "addpath(genpath("./examples"))" to add all examples to the Matlab path (recommended).
    -   In the command window type: "addpath(genpath("./examples/desiredFolder")) to add only examples in a desired subdirectory; replace "desiredFolder" with the corresponding name of the folder.
    -   Right-click of the examples folder and then select "Add to path" and then (as desired) folder or also all subfolders.

To execute an example run the corresponding script.

## Overview
In the following the current folder structure is depicted. Details for the examples can be found in the corresponding subfolder.
- `casos` root folder [PATH]
    - `+casos` (accessible as MATLAB package/namespace)
    - `examples`
